1. This code is a modification of the  2-dimensional implementation of a Barnes-Hut galaxy simulator by Jonas Latt (jonas.latt@unige.ch) as part of the University of Geneva's MOOC "Simulation and Modeling of Natural Processes". This modification involves the re-writting of some of the functions to model 3-dimensional systems, the inclusion of an appropiate system of units and the implementation of adecuate plotting and animation routines to obtain the visualization of the evolution of the system.
